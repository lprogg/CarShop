1. This repository describes a car shop that's building 3 different types of cars having or not autonomous driving modes and that's able of counting the total number of cars sold.
2. The project was built using 3 design patterns.
3. Creating a new car using a factory method in which we can introduce new car models without modifying the client code.
4. To inject different behaviours like the autonomous driving ability of the vehicle the strategy pattern was used.
5. To ensure that there's only one car shop created that's able of counting the total number of cars sold a singleton was used.
